# This is is Telegram Instant View template for a blogpost on a Jekyll with default Mimina theme.
# Check out the full documentation here: https://instantview.telegram.org/docs

# Place the version at the beginning of template. We recommend always using the latest available version of Instant View.
~version: "2.0"

### STEP 1: Define which pages get Instant View and which don't

# We only want to generate Instant View pages for Posts (_layouts/post.html). Other blog page layouts wont' be processed.
# Conveniently, all article pages on Jekyll seem to have a <meta property="article:published_time"> tag.
# If this tag is not present, we'll assume that the page is not an article and does not require an Instant View page.
# This *condition* does the trick:
?exists: /html/head/meta[@property="article:published_time"]

### STEP 2: Define the essential elements

# The 'body' and 'title' *properties* are required for an Instant View page to work. 
body:     //article
title:    $body//h1[1]

### STEP 3: some tunning to fit IV rules
# put <img src=".."> outside <p> 
@split_parent: //p/img

### STEP 4: other clean-ups
# remove excessive post meta
@remove: //p[has-class("post-meta")]
# remove <noscript> text
@remove: //noscript
